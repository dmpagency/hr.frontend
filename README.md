# Project Name: DMP Frontend Testing Project

## Objective:
Your task is to create a responsive web page based on the design provided in Figma:  
[Design Link](https://www.figma.com/design/TumeHzNdMGPfl9r1ImHLSv/dmpagency-frontend-technical-task?node-id=0-1&t=cMwsNzPqd3PaHLzG-1).  
Use **Bootstrap 5**, **Sass**, and the **BEM methodology**.

---

## Requirements:

### HTML and CSS:
1. **Structure**:  
   The page must follow the structure outlined in the design.
2. **BEM Methodology**:  
   Use the BEM naming convention for classes. Refer to [BEM Guide](https://www.vzhurudolu.cz/prirucka/bem).
3. **CSS Rules**:  
   - Follow a **mobile-first approach**.  
   - Avoid "magic constants" (always use variables or appropriate units, such as `em` or `rem`).  
   - Each component should be self-contained and independent of its parent.

---

### Responsiveness:
The page must be fully responsive and adapt seamlessly to mobile devices, tablets, and desktops.

---

### Technologies:
- **Bootstrap 5**.
- **Sass** (use variables for colors, sizes, etc.).
- **Figma** (for reading and referencing the design).
